# Filter

Filter is not just another social media platform; it's a haven for media creators and individuals seeking a space to express themselves without the fear of censorship or post deletion. Our commitment revolves around the principles of 100% transparency and unwavering support for freedom of speech.

The Filter UI is a marriage of aesthetics and user-friendliness. Meticulously designed, it effortlessly combines simplicity with effectiveness, ensuring a visually stunning experience for all.

In the development process of Filter, my vision expanded beyond the conventional customization options. Recognizing the desire for more than just light and dark themes, I sought to empower users with an array of personalization features. From crafting unique color themes to altering font appearances and tweaking the roundedness of borders on elements, the goal was to provide a platform that truly caters to individual tastes.

Going beyond the ordinary, I introduced a currency system within Filter. This innovative approach rewards users for their platform activity – posting, commenting, inviting others, engaging in private conversations, and garnering likes, comments, and shares. These efforts accumulate as coins, a virtual currency that users can later spend in the store. From badges and personalized creations to profile backgrounds, banners, animated avatars, app themes, icons, and more – all without spending a cent. For those who prefer a shortcut, coins are also available for purchase in the shop.

On the technical front, Filter is a social media platform with a ReactJS Framework frontend and a GoLang backend. The backbone of our system is the Fuego web server, meticulously crafted to handle requests, manage routing, and ensure security.

Security is paramount, and Filter employs military-grade encryption in the form of AES-256, coupled with complex algorithms. This dual approach guarantees maximum user security without compromising on performance.
