# Filter

Filter is social media platform intended for all media creators as well for those who just want to express their feelings without being censored or have to be scared of their 
post being deleted. We believe in 100% trasnparency and freedom of speech.

Filter UI is designed with beauty & easy-for-use in mind, it is simple effective yet beautiful.

While working on Filter, I had in mind to allow users much more customization of application than just switching between light and dark theme.
As one of people who likes nice color and custom design, I decided to offer users ability to create their own color themes, change appereance font, change roundnedd of 
borders on elemends etc...Of course, in my oppinion, this wasnt enough so I decided to step further and add more options which yet has to be developed and tested.

Just simple creating posts and sending messages is kinda boring, so I decided to make something like currency system whose main purpose is to allow users to, by being 
active on platform, making posts, commenting, inviting others, sending private and talking with other people as well as gaining likes, comments and shares on their own posts
earn coins which they can later use to buy some "perks" in store like badges, create their own ones, profile backgrounds, banners, animated avatars, app themes, icons and more
and all that without paying a dime. Of course, if they actually dont want to grind, they can simply buy coins in the shop and use them for whatever they like.

Now, to technical side, Filter is social media platform whose frontend is developed using ReactJS Framework while backend is done in GoLang.
It uses custom made minimal web server called __Fuego__ which main case is handling requests, routing and security.

It uses military grade encryption AES-256 and complex algorithms to provide maximum security of our users without losing on performances.
